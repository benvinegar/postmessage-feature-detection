h1. postMessage Feature Detection

This is a set of QUnit unit tests designed to evaluate postMessage implementations across browsers.

The tests are largely based on Opera's own postMessage tests:

h2. Motivation

I wanted a quick and easy way to identify holes in postMessage implementations across browsers. Just checking for !!window.postMessage (as suggested "here":http://diveintohtml5.org/everything.html) is *not* enough.

h2. Known Browser Quirks

 * Safari 4.0.5 doesn't fail for all malformed uris
 * Opera 9.64, 10.0b1-3 identifies window.postMessage, but fails most checks
 
h2. Todo

Still not compatible with IE8.
